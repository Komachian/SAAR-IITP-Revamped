# SAAR-IITP-Revamped
A revamp of the SAAR, IIT Patna website.

# Before you start working
### Pre-requisites
* XAMPP v8.0.0+ (Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
* Basic knowledge of PHP, HTML, Sass, jQuery (depending on your work)
* Some experience with CSS (depending on your work)

### How to run
1. Clone this repo in the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation directory (generally, `C:\xampp` on Windows, `/opt/lampp` on Linux and `/Applications/XAMPP` on Mac OS X) using the command:
```
git clone -branch revamp2 --depth 1 https://github.com/StrixROX/SAAR-IITP-Revamped.git
```
2. Start the XAMPP Control Panel and start the `Apache` module

3. Open your browser and go to `localhost/SAAR-IITP-Revamped`

Now you should be able to see the website.

#### NOTE: A good place to start would be the `src/` folder in the repo or the `index.php` file at the repo root.

#### NOTE: More comments will be added to the codebase soon.
